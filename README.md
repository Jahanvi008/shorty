# URL Shortner with my own domain

This is a URL Shortener project build during MLH: Global Hack Week. The project is designed to simplify redirecting to frequently visited websites by providing a shortened URL. The project utilizes HTML and Node.js to achieve this functionality and is hosted on a custom domain.

### Usage
To use the URL Shortener type, follow this steps:
1. Visit the custom domain where the URL Shortener is hosted i.e., i.jahanvim.co
2. Enter the website name you want to visit after the domain (i.jahanvim.co/website-name)
3. The URL Shortener will automatically redirect you to the specified website.

### Included websites
I have already added a list of websites that I use regularly. These websites can be accessed through the URL Shortener. The list may include:
- /ghw - Global Hack Week page
- /leetcode - LeetCode landing page
- /hackerrank: Hackerrank landing page
- /ontariotech: Ontario Tech University home page
- /linkedin-jahanvi: My LinkedIn profile 
- /github-jahanvi: My GitHub portfolio

### Requesting Additional Websites
I will keep updating the list regularly. If you have websites that you'd like to be added to the URL Shortener, please get in touch with me at jahanvimathukia28@gmail.com.
